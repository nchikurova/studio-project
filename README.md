No doubt 2020 will be remembered. We are making history right now and grandchildren of our grandchildren will probably learn about this year in school. Unforeseen and unpredictable Coronavirus pandemic began in China and has expanded all over the world in few months. Millions of people around the world have been sickened and hundreds of thousands of others have died. Many countries declared restrictive measures, such as lockdown, shelter in place, or stay at home orders, to contain the pandemic at a local level. One day it will all become history and when reading about this experience people would only imagine what weâ€™ve been through. 

The coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many Americans to generate income, and as a result, pay their rent.
