                    Most Americans say Coronavirus Outbreak has impacted their lives. As job losses and unemployment
                    were continuing to increase as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, more
                    than half of Americans who rent their residence say they lack confidence they will be able to
                    pay
                    May rent in full.

                    coronavirus got started)</a>

                Many countries have declared restrictive measures, such as lockdown, shelter in place, or stay at
                home
                orders, to contain the pandemic at a local level, including US. Unemployment rate has been growing
                as
                the virus was spreading affecting not only daily lives but the ability to buy food and pay rent.
