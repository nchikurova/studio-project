            were continuing to increase as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, more

                    The Household Pulse Survey</a> is a 20-minute online survey studying how
                the coronavirus pandemic is impacting households across the country from a social and economic
                perspective. The survey asks questions about how education, employment, food security, health, housing,
                social security benefits, household spending, stimulus payments, and transportation have been affected
                by the ongoing crisis.

                'Even before the pandemic, 23 million people in 10.7 million low-income households paid more than
                half their income in rent, and rents across the country had become increasingly unaffordable.
                The median renter household income rose just 0.5 percent from 2001 to 2018 after adjusting for
                inflation, while rents rose nearly 13 percent. Even before the pandemic, a parent working full-time
                at the federal minimum wage could not afford a modest two-bedroom apartment in any state without
                receiving rental assistance or having to make tough choices between paying the rent and meeting
                essential daily needs such as food, medicine, and child care. <br><br>When families spend so much of
                their income on rent, it is harder for them to save, which makes it
                nearly impossible to meet basic needs if they lose a job, their income falls, or costs for basic
                needs rise.'
